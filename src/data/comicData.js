        description: "Two years after the events of Harbour: The Ring of Deceit, Madeline Harbour has become a community heroine in most eyes... but some believe her to be no different than the corrupt officials she ousted. When a young girl by the name of Maeve Colbrun goes missing, Madeline must travel to the Western Isle and come face to face with the dangerous gangs that control it in order to find the missing girl. With the NSPD's Maxine Rubin on her tail, eager to solve the case before Madeline in order to redeem herself in the eyes of the public, Madeline and her team must rise up to the challenge of finding Maeve, proving they mean well, and avoiding the wrath of the West's criminal masterminds.",
